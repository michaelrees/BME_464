Image guidance find cancer- put in radioactive seeds embedded into the tissue, that deliver localized radiation

Task: Come up with a seed and external device to make the seed vibrate at prescribed frequencies
Second device to take advantage of vibration to see something

Why: Vibration: to take advantage of Doppler. Seeds don’t show up statically 
See if you can vibrate adjacent tissue and track the therapeutic progress of the seeds

Seeds ~22-16 Gauge needles

Radiation therapy is not important to design spec.
Beads could stay forever (?);  NOT trans-rectally 

Focal therapy 
-	Also done in the liver

Physical design depends on vibrational external gizmo (microcontroller to control) -- electromagnetic coupling (what’s the current needed)
-	How plate stirrers work
